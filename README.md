# Formless and Void

A form-inputs-and-git-collaboration project.

### The Basics

You'll be working **in groups** to make a form, with:

- The content that you (and your partners) decide on... be creative!
- Whatever form field types you want... go wild!
- Automatic printing of results thanks to the bit of JavaScript in `main.js`... don't touch!

### What Form

### Git Collaboration

You're going to work on this together using `git`. Here are your basic steps.

- One teammate will fork this repo. This will be the repo that everyone submits as an assignment.
- That teammate will add the other team members as "Collaborators".
- You will all `git clone` the repository to your machines.
- When it's someone else's turn to "drive", the current driver can push up (`git add` and `git commit -m "[some message]"` first!), and the new driver will do a `git pull` to get the changes the previous driver added.
- Always always _always_ `pull` before you start working.
- Repeat until you're done! (Make sure to push one final time.)
